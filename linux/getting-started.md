# Linux Getting Started
> Here's your joke, go ahead and compile it yourself

If you use Linux as your daily driver, I’m going to (perhaps?) naively assume you’re pretty good with technology 
already. However, if you need any assistance we will do whatever we can to help!

To get going with Linux, you’ll need the following packages installed:
* `build-essential`, or your distribution’s equivalent metapackage to install `gcc` and any associated tools.

* `python3` and `python3-pip`, or your distribution’s equivalent package(s) to get the latest version of Python 3 and 
Pip

* `python3-virtualenv`, or your distribution’s Python 3 virtual environment package

* Either a haskell-platform package, or a download of the 
[Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html) 

* The latest version of the JDK. Either you can download it from Oracle directly or you can use an 
installation package. This differs from platform to platform, but for Ubuntu I recommend installing Open-JDK using this
tutorial https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-18-04.

* JetBrains [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux), you can activate it 
using the student membership I mentioned at the beginning of this guide.

To test your setup you can use any of the examples under the MacOS or Windows guides.
