The getting started guide has already installed the Haskell Platform so we just need to setup the IDE.

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) either via brew or by downloading the image.

```bash
brew install visual-studio-code
```

2. Once installed, open and go to extensions on the left-hand side (4 squares with one offset) and install `Haskelly` 
which was written by UCL Computer Science students to give you pretty syntax highlighting for Haskell in VS Code.
Cool, huh?
