# Free Stuff
> GET SOME FREE STUFF HERE (also everyone should follow this part of the guide first)

Before going ahead and setting things up for your platform, get some free stuff online!

1.	**GitHub Student Pack**.
Head to [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get a GitHub Student Pack. This will 
get you a GitHub account (for sharing code) and allow you to have as many private repositories (now free for all) and 
wikis as you need while you’re a student (now free for all). There’s also a bunch of other free stuff in there. 
Cool, huh?

2.	**JetBrains Student Pack**.
Head to [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to get all the JetBrains products for 
free while you're a student; you just need to renew every year and it takes a couple of minutes. You will need this to 
get the recommended programming tools in this guide.
