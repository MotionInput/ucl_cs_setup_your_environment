# Free Stuff
> GET SOME FREE STUFF HERE (also everyone should follow this part of the guide first)

Before going ahead and setting things up for your platform, get some free stuff online!

1.	**GitHub Student Pack**.
Head to [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get a GitHub Student Developer
Pack. This will get you a free GitHub Pro account (for sharing code) with unlimited private/public repos
and give you access to a bunch of other free stuff like domain names, software, cloud hosting credits, and more
while youâ€™re a student. Cool, huh?

2.	**JetBrains Student Pack**.
Head to [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to get all the JetBrains products for 
free while you're a student; you just need to renew every year and it takes a couple of minutes. You will need this to 
get the recommended programming tools in this guide.
